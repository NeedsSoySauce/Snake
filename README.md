# Snake

The classic Snake game implemented in rust as a console application. Made while getting my feet wet with Rust.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/NeedsSoySauce/Snake.git`
2. Run `cargo run` from the project's root

## Todo

- [x] Build this into an actual console application
- [ ] Add cooler win/second place messages
- [ ] Look back at this when I'm more experienced with Rust and laugh at the all the mistakes I made
